# Google-Speech-to-Text

## About
Made this repo because couldn't find a good tutorial for Google Speech-To-Text API
- demo1.py for local audio file
- demo2.py for using Google Storage

## Requirements
```
pip install google-cloud-speech
```
Also, service account from Google Cloud Platform project and getting API KEY is required.
Download API key file for further credential confirmation.
